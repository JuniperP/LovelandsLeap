Loveland is a short platformer video game inspired by the folktales of the Loveland Frog, a cryptid from Ohio. This passion project was produced over a single summer by a small team using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org). We invite you to play for free on [Steam](TODO) or [Itch](TODO), as well as learn from, explore, and even modify our open source code.

## About

Loveland was originally produced for [Godot Wild Jam #70](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-70). After that initial (very broken) release, we continued working until it was ready to share with the world. This was a big milestone for our team, being our first game to come fully to fruition.

## Installation and Usage

To run the game locally, you will need to install Godot and clone this project.

> [!IMPORTANT]

1. Install [Godot 4.2 .NET](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2-stable/).
